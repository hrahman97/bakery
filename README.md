# bakery

This is a class project for CIS 4630, where the prompt was to create a website of choice from scratch. The process included wireframing, building UI/UX designs, and essentially creating a portfolio of all the components to be featured on the site. 

Finished website - https://hrahman97.github.io/bakery/
